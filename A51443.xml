            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>I know well, what I publiſh in <hi>Print,</hi> will find a Critical <hi>Comment,</hi> and cenſorious <hi>Paraphraſe</hi> from ſome; but, if I may benefit the ſouls of Gods ſuffering Saints, I am not careful to ſtop the mouth, or ſmooth the brow of a clamorous, or ſupercilious cenſure. I will not fear it worſe, nor expect it better in the whole Volume, then in a large Vineyard, that there be <hi>tàm uvae quàm labruſcae;</hi> ſome cluſters of ſound and ſweet grapes, which have their full blood, and true ſpiritual vigor; though withall, ſome of lighter digeſtion not ſo happy in their ſoil or ſun, and therefore not ripened to ſo divine a maturity and ſweetneſs. Neither am I ignorant or unexperienc'd, how much leſs the mind is affected with reading, then with hearing; even by how much a <hi>Preacher,</hi> in the particular gift of utterance, is
<pb facs="tcp:94092:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the more maſter of his tongue, then pen; and ſo can ſpeak much more piercingly to the eye, as an <hi>Orator,</hi> then as a <hi>Scribe.</hi> But, what my Pulpit-conceptions do loſe by the Preſs, as to their affecting heat; I hope they will have repair'd them by their informing light, the Judgment being more thorowly convinced by a frequent peruſal, then a ſingle delivery.</p>
                  <p>Whatſoever then you meet with of a devout vigor and ſolid nouriſhment, receive it as from the <hi>Store-houſe of Heaven,</hi> and only miniſtred by my hand; it is wholly God's, and yours. But whatſoever is flat or crude, weak and indigeſted; that's all mine own, it's like my ſelf, and I ſhall not refuſe, though bluſh, to father it. Accept the former, and excuſe the latter: And as in that, I ſhall further your Piety; ſo in this, do you expreſs your Charity, the charity of a fair con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction; conſidering my buſie and diſtracting charge of a <hi>School-Tuition,</hi> in which I am ſtill engag'd (and I bleſs God I am ſo;) as well to get ſubſiſtence, as employ my talent. This troubleſom Task may well plead a favorable interpretation. Which yet is not all the kindneſs I crave; your Prayers I ſue for, <hi>viz.</hi> That God will make me farther ſerviceable to his Church and you, whoſe I am in the ſtricteſt bond of love, and heartieſt zeal of devotion,</p>

                     <p>Now, there is no greater advantage unto Satan in his temptations, then the <hi>ignorance and error of the mind,</hi> when the Underſtanding is darkened or deceiv'd; <hi>darkened</hi> through want of knowledge, or <hi>deceiv'd</hi> with a falſe light. For Satan, he works ſtill contrary unto God, and yet in imitation of him too: And therefore as God in his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> operations of grace to beget life,<note place="margin">Eph. 1.17, 18.</note> he firſt <hi>enlightens and illuminates;</hi> ſo Satan in his temptations unto ſin, to deſtroy grace, he firſt <hi>darkens and deceives:</hi>

                        <note place="margin">Luk. 18.1.</note> therefore doth he make it the maſter-piece of his ſubtilty and malice, in all our afflictions of ſoul to damp our devotion of heart; knowing well, that there is no readier way to <hi>quench his fiery darts,</hi>

Some of which ends may be theſe. (1.) To chaſtiſe ſome ſtubborn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſpirit, and to correct ſome wilful diſobedience. Be the Saints of God never ſo dear to him, yet if they put out the light of councel, he will put out the light of comfort; if they break his bonds of rule, he will bind them in chains of diſtreſs. <hi>Wilful diſobedience</hi> is that curſed bramble,<note place="margin">Judg. 9.15.</note> from whence (as in <hi>Jotham's parable</hi>) there does come forth the fire of divine diſpleaſure to parch and wither the talleſt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Cedars of Lebanon, the devouteſt Saints of Chriſts Church. Or (2.) It may be we grow <hi>wanton</hi> with Gods ordinances, and he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore uncloaths them of their quickening vertue and refreſhing vigor, becauſe we approach them without awful reverence, and an holy fear. Or (3.) It may be the <hi>Heart</hi> begins to <hi>harden, and exalt it ſelf;</hi> and therefore God withdraws his favor, and ſecretly rebukes the ſoul with terrors, to bring the offender upon his knees, and lay him low in humiliations, melting him like wax, thereby fitted as more pliable <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> to receive the impreſſions of his grace, and the ſeal of his love. <q>O the ſtreams of ſpiritual comforts,<note place="margin">Jam. 4.6.</note> which water the fruitful vallies of humble ſouls, whilſt the lofty mountains of ſpiritual pride are parch'd with thirſt!</q> Or (4.) It maybe, God withdraws himſelf in his gracious preſence from the ſoul, to ſweeten, enlarge, and eſtabliſh its fuller comforts: The toil and troubles of a <hi>barren Wilderneſs,</hi> make more ſweet the milk and honey of a <hi>fruitful Canaan.</hi> As Nature hath its times and ſeaſons, ſo hath Grace; the Winter-froſts prepare <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> for Summer-fruits, and the pruning furthers a better growth.

                        <p>It is indeed <hi>the method of Gods dealing with a ſoul,</hi> firſt to humble it by a <hi>ſpirit of bondage,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Rom. 8 15.</note> then to raiſe it by a <hi>ſpirit of adoption.</hi>

Again, he withdraws himſelf in his ſpiritual comforts wherewith he cheriſht our faith and love, that he may try their ſtrength, and prove their ſincerity, further rooting the ſoul in humility and godly fear; and after this, Grace having taken deep root in the heart, it brings forth the more abundant fruit of peace and comfort to the ſoul. Yea, hereby God not only tries <hi>our love</hi> to him, but the more endears <hi>his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> love</hi> to us; in that when we ſeem'd in our ſelves to be wholly loſt, and quite caſt off, he then appeared in the Mount, in our greateſt extremity, for ſuccor and ſalvation; turning the ſigns of his wrath into teſtimonies of his love, and changing our diſmal eſtate of doubts and fears, and mournings, into a glad condition of holy confidence, enlarg'd hope, and refreſhing comforts. Oh how muſt this needs win the heart to a greater enlargement of love, when it feels it ſelf reſtor'd to ſo great an enlargement of delight? yea, ſo cleer an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> of Gods favor, in having brought us through the fire,<note place="margin">Mal. 3.2.3. 2 Tim 2 21. 1 Pet. 2.9.</note> and purified us to himſelf <hi>a peculiar treaſure,</hi> even veſſels of honor.

                           <note place="margin">Mal. 4 2.</note> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that they may know and own their dependance upon him, he oftentimes ſhuts in his light, and then the ſoul preſently finds it ſelf in a diſmal and darkſom deep of mournful diſtreſs: And oh what a ſhop of fears is this gulf of darkneſs! what ſad apprehenſions amaze <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> the ſoul! But now, when Chriſt breaks forth in his light of comfort and peace, oh the tranſporting joy that attends this return of love!

                        <p>Outward afflictions become like the <hi>cloudy pillar,</hi> they have a dark ſide to the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> that is, wrath and vengeance to the obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate; but a light ſide to the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> that is, correction and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> to the penitent. The metal and the droſs have the ſame fire, but not the ſame effect; the metal is refin'd, and the droſs is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed: yea, the ſame judgments of God are to the godly corrections and trials, which to the wicked are vengeance and puniſhment: The ſufferings of the godly, though materially the ſame, yet differ much from thoſe of the wicked, even as much as chaſtiſements of love differ from judgments of wrath, or healing medicines from deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive potions. <hi>To illuſtrate this:</hi> Suppoſe two men have their hands <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> cut off, the one by ſentence of the Judge, the other by the advice of the Chyrurgion; the matter of the ſuffering is the ſame, not the manner and form; for to the one it is a cure, to the other a puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; to the one an healing of a ſore, to the other an executing of juſtice. The afflictions then of Gods children, they are not <hi>formal puniſhments;</hi> for that, though they be occaſioned by ſin, yet are they not inflicted by way of revenge, which is the true nature of puniſhment properly ſo called. Indeed, God cannot be rightly ſaid <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> to puniſh thoſe ſins which he forgives; for that, Chriſt being our Mediator, takes away guilt and puniſhment too.<note place="margin">Jer. 31.34.</note> And therefore God ſo <hi>forgives iniquity, that he remembers it no more:</hi> But ſure, remember it he does, if after forgiveneſs he yet puniſh it.</p>
                        <p>Whereas then,<note place="margin">2 Sam. 12.14.</note> notwithſtanding God had told <hi>David</hi> by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, that he had <hi>put away his ſin;</hi> yet he both threatens, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards executes wrath againſt him by reaſon of his ſin.

So that,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.1.</note> 
                           <hi>There is no condemnation to them which are in Chriſt Jeſus;</hi> and if no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, then no puniſhment: For what is puniſhment, but the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> execution of the juſt condemnation which is paſt by God upon the guilt of ſin? S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> then gives us a ſhort and full reſolution, that <hi>verè Chriſtus communicando nobiſcum ſine culpa poenam, &amp; cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pam ſolvit &amp; poenam;</hi> Chriſt by communicating with us of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment without ſin, hath taken away both ſin and puniſhment. The afflictions then of the faithful, they proceed from God as a provident Father, not as an avenging Judge; and are not for ſatisfying of <hi>his</hi>

juſtice, but the reforming of <hi>their</hi> lives. To cloſe: What is it that moſt retards our pace, tyres our ſpirits, and dulls our vigor in the way to life and glory, but the Corruption in our hearts, and the Croſs on our ſhoulders?

Beſides, it is <hi>here</hi> an inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Policy, (though in <hi>Religion</hi> no right Piety) by offering a Suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to the Mother, to make more acceptable to the Son; and by making an oblation to the Son, to become the better accepted of the Mother: For thus, I have a Patronage ſecur'd by a Mediation, which will not be denied. And indeed, it is auſpicious this, that confuting Schiſm, I have an United <hi>Patronage</hi> for my protection. But, that the Inſcription of Your <hi>Names</hi> may appear neither inſolency nor inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation; be pleas'd to know, the main deſign of this Dedication is, to be a Monument of Gratitude to the happy memory and excellent merit of that Illuſtrious Perſonage, <hi>JAMES Duke of Richmond and Lenox, &amp;c.</hi> the deceaſed Husband and Father: In whom Vertue gave Honor its perfect tincture: He was truly FAITHFUL and RELIGIOUS; A Title which doth eternize his Name and Perſon. Now, that from him my former Labors received approbation, and my ſelf encouragement, I cannot acknowledge on a fitter Scene, nor perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuate in a firmer Record, then this of a Publick <hi>Dedication.</hi>

                     <pb facs="tcp:94092:105"/>Thus <hi>(Madam)</hi> you ſee what tribute of Thankfulneſs I owe to your deceaſed <hi>Lord:</hi> And to whom ſhall I pay the debt, but either to the Executrix, or the Heir? the Heir to his Fathers vertues and goodneſs, as well as Honors and Eſtate. And here I cannot but congratulate that enlarged comfort your <hi>Grace</hi> hath, in beholding the fair hopes of this tender Youth, ſo green and flouriſhing; his Heroick diſpoſition ſheweth of what Stock he comes; A <hi>Generous Plant,</hi> which watered by a skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful hand, and cheriſhed with an Heavenly influence, will doubtleſs grow up to be a lofty <hi>Cedar</hi> in our <hi>Libanus,</hi> whoſe leaves will ſhade, and boughs will ſhelter; being as ſpreading, as tall; as good, as great; as vertuous, as honorable. And thus, whilst after-Ages bluſh at the Prodigies of this, they, reading your Name <hi>(My Lord)</hi> upon record, ſhall adore the Providence, which hath preſerv'd, in You, a Nurſery of Heroick worth; which, maugre all the malice and miſchief of degenerate Times, ſhall flouriſh to Poſterity; and bleſs After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayes with that, we deplore as loſt in ours, Piety, Prudence, and Honor, the trueſt Patriots of a Nations happineſs, and the Churches peace.<note place="margin">

                     </note> May your Perſon <hi>(My Lord)</hi> be as proſperous, as your Name's auſpicious: A <hi>Name</hi> that ſpeaks Nobility of the beſt ſtock, <hi>Antient Deſcent;</hi> and of the faireſt impreſsion too, <hi>Vertue and Valor.</hi> I will not preſume to inſtruct your tender Age, knowing well in what Artiſts hands you are for the Jewels poliſhing: Only, what is preſented may happily contribute to the right informing of your Noble Youth, that no Falſe Light of our Days Impoſtures may ſeduce you to become a <hi>Proſelyte</hi> of Hereſie and Schiſme; but as a true <hi>Diſciple</hi> of the Holy <hi>Jeſus,</hi> you may be firm in the faith, religious in your life, bleſſed in your death, and glorious to Eternity.</p>
                  <p>Now, as I have begun, ſo I ſhall cloſe my <hi>Dedication,</hi> with an happy Union; not declaring only mine own thoughtt, but even Fame's report; That you are <hi>(Madam)</hi> an happy Mother, in ſo good a Son; and that you are <hi>(My Lord)</hi> an happy Son, in ſo good a Mother.

planting, is requiſit and neceſſary in the propagating the Church of Chriſt, as being productive of iſſue and ſucceſſion in the Miniſtry; which Miniſtry ſhall continue in the Church, whileſt the Church continues in the world. And now, ſeeing that onely Apoſtles and Apoſtolick-men did ordain; and that no meer Presbyters in all the Scriptures are expreſt, nor in all Church Hiſtory allowed, we ſee, by what Ordination we receive our <hi>Saviours</hi> Miſſion here, of a <gap reason="foreign">

                        <p>But, before we paſs this point, it will be ſome further confirmation, and much more illuſtration of the truth, that we give you ſome plea of <hi>Divine Reaſon,</hi> to make good the equity of our preſent aſſertion. Know then, in the Apoſtles times, and Infant-ſtate of the Church, Pariſhes were not divided, nor Congregations with their particular Miniſters fixt and ſetled; but in one City there were many Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> and ſtill, as Believers increaſed, their Meetings and Aſſemblies being in ſeveral places, they had ſeveral perſons aſſigned them for the ſervice of the Miniſtry; which how could it be well ordered without confuſion, but by the Authority and Preſidency of ſome one above the reſt? Which Preſidency the Apoſtles, during their over-ſight over the Churches, they retained in themſelves; but upon their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move, they committed to ſome Apoſtolick-men, as their Succeſſors. And indeed it is moſt agreeable to right reaſon, that that office ſhould <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> not expire, whoſe end did continue; and ſuch is the end of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolical Preſidency, even the preventing Schiſm, and the preſerving Order and Unity in the Church.</p>
                        <p>A Prudential Experience doth tell us, it is with <hi>Chriſts Church</hi> as with <hi>Davids</hi> Harp; in all, a parity of office is as far from peace, as the uniſon of ſtrings is from harmony; ſubordination in ſome, and ſuperiority in others, is as requiſit to Eccleſiaſtical as Civil Polity, without which, <hi>Schiſm</hi> becomes as fatal to the Church, as <hi>Rebellion</hi> 
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> is to the State.

                           <hi>Tot in Eccleſiis efficientur Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mata, quot Sacerdotes.</hi> There will be as many Schiſms in the Church, as there are Presbyters; eſpecially if every Presbyter hath power of Ordination intrinſecal to his Office, by the Divine Right of Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lical Inſtitution: For, what then would be the uſe of Ordination, but chiefly to propagate Schiſm?</p>

                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> But ſome may ſay, to prevent this.

But I ask by what Authority of Scripture they do it; and what Primitive patte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>If it were not ſo the Jews children, which were in Church-communion before their parents became Chriſtians, they ſhould loſe the priviledge they before enjoyed, and become ſo far from being bettered in their eſtate by their parents believing in Chriſt come in the fleſh, that their eſtate is made very much worſe: And if this be ſo, that children loſe the benefit and bleſſing under the Goſpel which they enjoyed under the Law, ſhew us what guilt in infants forfeited it, or what act of Chriſt repeal'd it. Sure we are,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> infants were members of the Jewiſh Church; and that of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,<note place="margin">Mar. 10.14.</note> 
                           <hi>Suffer little children to come unto me,</hi> we ſhall hereafter prove, confirms them members of the Chriſtian.</p>
                        <p>To enlarge a little further. When <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> are united, we find in Scripture,<note place="margin">Eph. 2.14.</note> it is by <hi>taking down the partition-wall,</hi> not taking away the Churches communion: If there were any change in this, ſure we are, it were for the better, not for the worſe, even ſuch as might advance the grace and riches of the Goſpel; ſo that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> the Jews ſhould not loſe, though the Gentiles gain; not they have leſs priviledge, though the Gentiles more, in being one Church with them. Wherefore, that children ſhould be in Church-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion before Chriſt's, and not after Chriſt's coming in the fleſh, is ſo abſurd a Tenent and opinion, as deſerves none other confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation then to be hiſt out of the Church. Yet for your clearer ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:94092:135"/>
I thus plainly and fully argue the cauſe. When the Jews were converted to the faith of Chriſt, did their children which were before <hi>Church-members,</hi> then ceaſe to be of the Churches commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion? If ſo, I ask what caſt them out? If the repealing of that pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge, give teſtimony of that repeal; if the forfeiting that bleſſing, give witneſs of that forfeiture. On the contrary, did the Infant-children of the believing Jews retain, and ſhall not then the Infant-children <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> of believing Gentiles receive this priviledge of the Churches communion? Sure, had it been the doctrine or practice of Chriſt or his Apoſtles, to exclude Infants from the communion of the Church; we ſhould have heard on't, and that loudly too, from the unbelieving Jews complaints and clamors, though the <hi>Apostles</hi> pens and tongues had been ne'r ſo ſilent. Yea doubtleſs, had this ſo dearly priz'd, this ſo long enjoy'd priviledge been either prohibited or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, ſo great a change of ſo great a concernment would have <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> had ſome ſpecial precept to warrant it, or, even amongſt believers themſelves, ſome notable diſpute, if not diſturbance rais'd about it.</p>

Is it by an inherent quality of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> ſanctification? No, but by a relative holineſs of Church-communion. To underſtand the Apoſtle, obſerve, the holineſs he ſpeaks of, is that proper to Diſciples, not common to them with Infidels. So that when the Apoſtle ſays, <hi>Elſe were your children unclean, but now are they holy;</hi> if his meaning ſhould be interpreted to be this, Elſe were your children Baſtards, but now they are legitimate; the Apoſtle thus interpreted ſhould be made to ſpeak what is moſt falſe, for that the children of wedlock are no more baſtards with the Pagans then <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> with the Chriſtians. So that, it is not the believing parent that can give the holineſs of legitimation, as the <hi>Anabaptiſt</hi> would evade the Apoſtle; and therefore no ſuch holineſs is here intended. But <hi>what holineſs</hi> is it then, that the Apoſtle ſpeaks of? Why, it is an holineſs of Church-fellowſhip and communion, in a right to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes and priviledges of the Goſpel. And this <hi>external holineſs</hi> it is, which is tranſmitted from the parent to the child, like that of <hi>political freedom</hi> tranſmitted from the father to the ſon. Thus as a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Free-man begets a Free-man, and Jews begot Jews, ſo Chriſtians beget Chriſtians, not by vertue of natural generation, but by right of Church-communion: So that, as Iſrael is ſaid to be an <hi>holy nation,</hi> an <hi>holy ſeed,</hi> ſo are the infants of believers ſaid to be <hi>holy children,</hi> as dedicate and ſeparate unto God; the proper notion of a relative holineſs, ſo often ſpoken of throughout the Scriptures.</p>

                        <p>So that, from theſe three Arguments, 1.

right who is a believer, that brings in the infant by vertue of the promiſe. Herein then is the ground of error, that men imagine we affirm, the childs right to the bleſſing of the promiſe, is in himſelf as a child; whereas it is in the believing parent, who conveys the right in this relation to the infant, that it is his child; his, to whom God hath oblig'd himſelf by the promiſe of his covenant, that he will be <hi>his God, and the God of his ſeed.</hi> Indeed it is worth our obſerving, that in the right manner of entring covenant with God, no parent <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> can enter ſingle, but he muſt ſtipulate for himſelf and his children. And this is plain, both from the condition on mans part, and the promiſe on God's: On God's part, the promiſe runs to us and our children, that <hi>he will be our God;</hi> and on our part, the condition runs from us and our children, that <hi>we will be his people:</hi> That as by vertue of the promiſe, God makes it his act of grace, that the ſeed of the godly be bleſſed; ſo by vertue of the condition, the godly make it their duty of obedience, that their children be given up <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> unto God, and tutour'd to fear him.</p>
                        <p>Thus, apparent it is, that our infant-children have an intereſt in the covenant of grace; for that the tenor of the covenant, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe and condition, ſo takes in the children with the parents, that the parents cannot covenant either excluding, or not including their children. This then remains as a firm ground and ſure reaſon of infants being parties in the communion of the Church, that they are parties in the covenant of grace.

                        <p>And whereas the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> urge us to inſtance in any Infant baptized in the Scripture, we urge them to ſhew in all Scripture, or in any other Hiſtory; where or when any Infant of believing Parents was paſt by, and not baptized till years of diſcretion? let all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords be ſearched, and the account of times examined, from that period <hi>John Baptist</hi> begun his Miniſtry, to that <hi>John the Evangeliſt</hi>

This is infalilble; Chriſts evangelical ordinance does in nothing oppoſe his moral com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand;
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:94092:147"/>
and therefore the ceremony of his Sacrament muſt not be made ſuch, as may hazard the life of the perſon celebrating that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament and ceremony. Beſides, <hi>Baptiſm</hi> is preſcribed to all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and ſure, its manner of miniſtration being common to all, muſt be poſſible to all: Which yet it cannot be, if (as ſome <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> would have it) to dip and plunge in water be <hi>eſsential</hi> to Baptiſm; for that, ſome Countries have not water enough to drink, and not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> a River or Brook within fifty, no, not an hundred miles com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs.</p>
                        <p>But laſtly, as the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> have in this no ſtrength of argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, from the propriety of the word, the ſignification of the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, the preſcript of Chriſt, ſo nor from any plain <hi>pattern</hi> or ſure <hi>example</hi> in the Scriptures. For, the Baptiſms we read of to have been in Rivers, were (as is moſt probable) after this manner: The perſon <hi>baptizing,</hi> and the perſon <hi>baptized</hi> put off their ſandals, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> without any further preparation, went together up to the ankles or mid-leg into the water; of which the Miniſter of Baptiſm taking up in his hand, he poured out upon the head of the baptiz'd. That this was the manner of <hi>John's</hi> baptiſm, is (to me) plainly intimated,<note place="margin">Act. 1.5.</note> when our Saviour gives in promiſe to his Apoſtles, That whereas <hi>John baptized with water,</hi> they ſhould be <hi>baptized with the Holy Ghost.</hi> Now, how were the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> baptized with the Holy Ghoſt, but by pouring out of the Spirit? and ſo how did <hi>John</hi> baptize with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> water, but by pouring out of that element?

                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> did baptize by plunging in the water, the people were fitted with ſome covering for that ſervice; and that ſuch multitudes in ſo ſhort a time ſhould be provided of neceſſaries for ſuch a baptiſm, ſeems to me altogether improbable.</p>

we read plainly this cuſtom ſetled in the Church; and the ſame piety and prudence which firſt inſtituted this ceremony, does ſtill perſwade its continuance. For, as formerly to preſerve from Heatheniſm, ſo now to preſerve from Hereſie, it is the pious and prudent care of the Church to engage the promiſe of Sureties, with the duty of Parents, to ſecure their Childrens inſtruction and education in the Faith. Enquir ng into the original of Suretiſhip in the behalf of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> Infants, we find it commonly known and uſed of old among the <hi>Jews:</hi> The Rulers of the Conſiſtory taking the care and charge of the young Proſelytes; and the <hi>Houſe of Judgment,</hi> that is, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, entring promiſe to inſtruct them in the knowledge of what they had undertaken.</p>

Thus ſaith Satan to the Lord Chriſt, againſt the Apoſtate Chriſtian: <hi>AEquiſsime Judex, judica quod aquum eſt:</hi> Moſt juſt Judge, judge what is right; judge him to be mine, who refuſed to be thine, even <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> after he had renounced me in Baptiſm. <hi>Ut quid invaſit pannos meos?</hi> What had he to do to wear my livery?

Conſider, oh conſider how this plea of Satan ſhall be thy confuſion of face, and horror of ſoul.</p>
                        <p>Be convinc'd then, <hi>O man,</hi> whoſoever thou art that quitteſt the covenant of thy God; be convinc'd, that by thy Apoſtacie thou doſt enter covenant with the Devil; in quitting the ſervice of Chriſt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> the Prince of light, thou art enſlav'd to Satan the Prince of darkneſs.

Wherefore then, O man, let this, this one conſideration more ſink deep into thy heart; Even what ſhame and confuſion ſhall cover thy face, what dread and horror ſhall ſeiſe thy ſoul, when at the laſt day Satan ſhall thus plead againſt thee before <hi>Chriſts tribunal,</hi> ſaying; As for this wicked perſon, and <hi>wilful Apoſtate,</hi> I never created him, nor redeemed him, and that himſelf well knew; I never ſuffered buffetings or ſcourgings for his ſake; I was never crucified or ſlain for his ſin; I never promiſed heaven and the fellowſhip of the bleſſed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> upon his obedience: And yet, <hi>O Chriſt,</hi> he hath obeyed me, and hath contemned thee; and this after he had covenanted to be thine, even covenanted in the ſight of thoſe Angels which now ſtand in thy preſence, and can give teſtimony to this truth.</p>
                        <p>Who art thou, upon whoſe guilty ſoul this Satans plea takes firm impreſſion? Remember, O remember thy vow in Baptiſm, when thou didſt oblige thy ſelf by covenant, to be the <hi>faithful ſoldier and ſervant of Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> And remembring this, fight no longer <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> under Satans colours, <hi>Hereſie, Schiſm,</hi> and <hi>Profaneneſs;</hi> but betake thy ſelf by faith and repentance to the <hi>Captain of thy ſalvation,</hi>

                        <p>Now, this antient, perpetual, and univerſal conſent of holy Doctrine, collected out of the moſt conſonant Writings of the Primitive Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and the ſacred Decrees of the firſt Councils; This is that we may call, in the language of St. <hi>Ambroſe, Liber Sacerdotalis,</hi>

and conſecrated by the blood of the holieſt Martyrs. As then the Authority of the ſacred Scriptures gives us the <hi>ſure rule</hi> of Faith, ſo the judgment of the Univerſal Church gives us the <hi>right line</hi> of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation; according to which two, it is well worthy our obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the Church of <hi>England</hi> did exactly draw the platform of her <hi>Reformation.</hi> And this is evident in her Doctrine and Practice; (1) In her Doctrine;<note place="margin">Art. 20.</note> amongſt many other inſtances, ſee it in her Book of <hi>Articles,</hi> expreſly acknowledging the Church to be the witneſs, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> keeper of the ſacred Oracles; and in her Book of <hi>Canons,</hi> as expreſly denying any doctrine neceſſary to be religiouſly held and believed, which the Catholick Fathers, and old Biſhops of the Primitive Church have not collected out of the Scriptures. And (2) that her practice is ſuitable to her Doctrine, appears by her owning the four <hi>General Councils;</hi> the <hi>Apoſtles, Nicen,</hi> and <hi>Athanaſian</hi> Creeds: And in all her diſputes againſt the now ſilent adverſary, otherwiſe too buſily em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, the <hi>Jeſuite;</hi> juſtifying her reformed eſtate, as conformed to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> the Primitive Church, within the firſt five Centuries of years.</p>
                        <p>And here, give me leave to obſerve unto you, how the <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery</hi> laid the way to their own, and our Churches ruine; even, by ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up private interpretation of Scripture, in oppoſition to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived judgment of the Univerſal Church.

The <hi>Presbyterian</hi> abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſheth the Publick Liturgy, and takes away Regular Ordination; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> brings in the Directory, and ſets up Lay Elders; and all upon this ground, That what they did was conformed to the Doctrine of the Scriptures; of whoſe interpretation, themſelves would be Judges. But, at the heels of the <hi>Presbyterian,</hi> follows cloſe the <hi>Independent,</hi> and treading in his ſteps, at laſt over-teacheth him in his deſign, and carries away his <hi>Helena</hi> from him; he pulls down the Claſſes, and the Synod, as humane inventions, and remains of Antichriſt, denying, That by the Scripture, any <hi>Presbyters</hi> or perſons whatſoever, ought <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> to have power over the Churches of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> which are by Scripture-rule Independent in their Government, to any Secular or Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical power whatſoever. And for this, they urge their Scripture Texts, with much heat of contention againſt the <hi>Presbytery;</hi> plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this their <hi>common ground,</hi> of interpretering Scripture by the Spirit, whoſe inſpirations and revelations they pretend to, above what the <hi>Presbytery</hi> dare own or acknowledge.</p>
                        <p>As then, in joyning the Authority of the Scripture with the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> of the Church, was our <hi>Reformation;</hi> ſo is it <hi>Satans</hi> ſubtlety, and the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> deſign, both acting by the <hi>Enthuſiaſt,</hi> That in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding the judgment of the Church from the authority of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, may be our ruine.

                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> This were indeed to the purpoſe, if thoſe maxims, known prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Nature and Reaſon, had never been heard of, but by <hi>Scripture Revelation:</hi> But, in that, holy <hi>Scripture</hi> points us ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly to thoſe <hi>maxims</hi> in general; it withal directs us implicitely to the uſe of Nature and Reaſon in all ordinary affairs in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular.</p>
                        <p>To convince you more fully of the great danger, ſee the evil con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequents of this Erroneous opinion; which are eſpecially theſe three.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> 1. An unavoidable guilt of Superſtition. 2. A vexatious perplexity of Conſcience. 3. A ſeditious contempt of Humane Laws, whether Civil or Eccleſiaſtical.</p>
                        <p>Firſt, <hi>An unavoidable guilt of Superſtition.</hi> For that, this opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on takes away the indifferency of things and actions, making all ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary as commanded, or elſe to be ſinful: So that, it is well obſerved, the <hi>Romaniſt</hi> and <hi>Separatist,</hi> as they go upon contrary grounds, yet both falſe; ſo they run into quite contrary errors, yet both ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> The error and ſuperſtition Affirmative on the one hand, that's the <hi>Romaniſts;</hi> who, cutting ſhort the <hi>Scriptures</hi> perfection, impoſe <hi>Humane tradition,</hi> with an opinion of abſolute neceſſity, and divine authority. The Error and Superſtition Negative on the other hand, that's the <hi>Separatiſts;</hi> who, extending too long, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther laying too low, the <hi>Scriptures</hi> perfection, they condemn Natural and Civil Actions, with a cenſure of being ſinful, which yet the Word of God condemneth not.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
                        </p>
                        <p>And thus, to take away what is indifferent in its ſelf, by command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it as abſolutely neceſſary; or forbidding it, as abſolutely unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, is Superſtitious: By commanding it as neceſſary, when Gods Word requires it not; and by forbidding it as unlawful, when Gods Word condemns it not.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, <hi>A vexatious perplexity of Conſcience.</hi> Oh how is a
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:94092:160"/>
conſcientious man intangled in a ſnare of perplexities, ſurrounded with a maze of diſtractions! Who cannot in his ordinary affairs of life, be quieted in his Conſcience, in the reſolution of things lawful and expedient, without <hi>Scripture</hi> proofs to determine it. The rule of Reaſon, That is readily applied by a man of ordinary prudence; but the rule of <hi>Scripture,</hi> is not to be applied to every action, by the ableſt Textuary in the World; he ſtands in need to carry a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> Concordance in his hand, who makes the <hi>Scripture</hi> the onely rule of all his actions; and yet not avoid perplexity of Conſcience neither.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, <hi>A ſeditious contempt of Humane Laws, whether Civil or Eccleſiaſtical.</hi> This opinion is that which will break the bonds of all ſubjection, and temporal obedience, both of children to Parents, of ſervants to Maſters, and of ſubjects to Soveraigns; who will by influence of this Error, queſtion when they ſhould obey, and call into <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> diſpute, when they ſhould put in practice, the lawful commands of their Superiors.</p>
                        <p>As for theſe kinde of men, who will not obey <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> (for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth) but in a <hi>Goſpel-way,</hi> upon a <hi>Scripture</hi> proof for every Law, I call the whole World to witneſs, whether ever yet, they proved themſelves good ſubjects; and ſure we are, according to that <hi>maxim</hi> of antient and known experience, <hi>Qui neſcit ſervire, neſcit impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rare,</hi> He that knows not how to ſerve, knows not how to govern; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> they will never make good Maſters, who themſelves never were good ſervants.</p>
                        <p>Thus, having diſcovered to you the dangerous falſhood, and evil conſequents of this <hi>Vulgar Error,</hi> That the ſacred <hi>Scriptures</hi> are the onely rule of all our actions; give me leave to anſwer the <hi>Objections</hi> urged by the Brethren of the <hi>Separation,</hi> the firſt broachers, and the continued abettors of this Error. Their main <hi>Arguments</hi> and <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections</hi> are drawn from that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Whatſoever ye do,</hi>

                        <p>The firſt <hi>Argument</hi> is framed thus, <hi>We muſt do all to Gods glory;</hi> but <label type="milestone">

But, by Faith, moſt evident it is, the Apoſtle means an inward per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion of minde, believing, That what we do, may lawfully be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> done; whereas to do any thing, of which we are not thus perſwaded, it is ſin: So that, by Faith here, the Apoſtle does not mean the doctrine of Scripture, but the dictate of Conſcience; and moſt certain it is, Let the light and information of Conſcience be from Reaſon, as well as from Scripture, the dictate of Conſcience cannot be reſiſted without ſin againſt God, whoſe Vicegerent it is in the Soul of Man.</p>

                           <hi>in its larger acception,</hi> as the Church of the Elect.

                        <p>True it is, as concerning the Angels, that Chriſt he aſſumed not <hi>their nature</hi> in his Conception, and ſo neither did he ſuſtain <hi>their perſon</hi> in his Paſſion; <hi>He took not on him, the nature of Angels,</hi>

and laying hold on one running away, to bring him back; or a catch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him that is faln, to recover him from the pit.

                        <p>Angels and Men, were indeed created happy, in that natural bleſſedneſs of Spiritual contemplation, but not in that ſupernatural bliſs of the beatifical Viſion. Which beatifical Viſion, being the laſt end of the rational and intellectual Creature, could not be attained by any ordinary work of nature, but by ſome extraordinary act of grace; for to be, and to be bleſſed, is one and the ſame in none but <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> God: And therefore, to be is from nature, but to be perfectly bleſſed, is from grace; as the laſt end of being, in a perfect commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with God, through Chriſt by love. So that, it is conſonant to the Analogy of Faith, to believe and affirm, That the eſtate of the now bleſſed Angels, was at the firſt mutable and ſubject to alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and that, preſently, by the ſupererogating grace of God thorow Chriſt, they became no longer ſubject to mutability and change; now inſeparably adhering to God, and ſo poſſeſſing perfect happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;<note place="margin">Matth. 18.10.</note> of whom our Saviour hath ſaid <gap reason="foreign">

The internal and eſſential form of the Church, conſiſts in union with Chriſt, through the Spirit, the object of Faith, and not of Senſe; in which regard, the Church muſt needs be inviſible. But now, the external and accidental form of the Church, is the Miniſtry <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> of the Word and Sacraments, with a publick profeſſion of the true Faith of Chriſt; and in this, the Church muſt needs be viſible, yea, by how much that profeſſion and Miniſtry is the more publick and pure, by ſo much is the Church, the more conſpicuous and glorious.</p>
                        <p>The Church then, as it is viſible, may be thus defined; to be, <hi>The whole company of men and women profeſsing the Faith of Chriſt, in the ſincere preaching of the Word, and right adminiſtration of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> Sacraments.</hi> (And this is the definition of the Church, according to its external and accidental form; that definition before given being according to its form Internal and Eſſential;) and by this we may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, how men are ſaid to be of the Church, and to be in Chriſt, either by outward profeſſion, or by inward ſanctification, that, an external, this, an internal communion; by the outward profeſſion of an external communion onely, ſo the <hi>Formal Hypocrite;</hi> by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſanctification of an internal, as well as the outward profeſſion <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> of an external communion, ſo the <hi>Truly Regenerate.</hi>

                        <p>Many there are then, who bear the name of <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> ay, and of <hi>Catholicks</hi> too, who yet are in Chriſt,<note place="margin">John 15.2, 6</note> but as <hi>withered branches in the Vine;</hi> yea, they are in the Church, as Wens in the Body; not in a vital and internal communion, but in a formal and external profeſſion.

In all her variety of ſtates and conditions <hi>Non mutat voluntatem, ſed vult mutationem,</hi> (ſo the <hi>Schools</hi> from the <hi>Maſter</hi> of the <hi>Sentences,</hi> and he from St. <hi>Auguſtine.</hi>) When God alters his work, he changeth not his will, but wills thoſe changes; ſo, as to eſtabliſh his promiſes: Amongſt which promiſes to his Church,<note place="margin">Matth 16.18.</note> obſerve that, <hi>The Gates of Hell ſhall not prevail againſt her.</hi> And again, <hi>Lo, I am with you,</hi> ſaith our Saviour; what onely for a ſhort time?<note place="margin">Matth. 28.20.</note> No, it is for a long date, <hi>alway;</hi> even <hi>unto the end of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> the world.</hi> Indeed, to ſuppoſe the Church to fall totally from grace, were to ſeparate Chriſt from being Head, and to divide him from the Body;<note place="margin">Eph. 1.23.</note> and ſo make him who is the fulneſs of perfection, to be him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf imperfect.</p>
                        <p>Of particular viſible Churches indeed, we ſay, That they have, and may fall away; ſo did the Church of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the time of <hi>Elijah,</hi> ſo hath the Church of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> of <hi>Antioch,</hi> of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and many other particular Churches, they have faln away; yet the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> hath not. But ſtill in the height of Hereſie, there have been ſome to profeſs the truth; in the deepeſt Apoſtacy, ſome to hold faſt unto Chriſt, and the purity of his worſhip.

                        <p>But further yet, I obſerve, The old Adverſaries of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Faith, the Papiſts, they take advantage of our preſent diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> and whilſt our Church labors under an Eclipſe, they ſeek to gain Proſelytes by this Argument, <hi>viz.</hi> Neceſſary it is to be of ſome Church, for it is a truth received on all hands, That out of the Church there is no Salvation; and now as for the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> (ſay they) where is it? or, what is it?

                        <p>Now, if by theſe ſymptoms of Spiritual life from Chriſt, as the Head; we can evidence to our ſelves that we are living Members of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> the Church, as his Body: Then, be we further exhorted, to live as ſuch who profeſs a communion with that Body, whereof Chriſt Jeſus is the Head.

Thus ſays our Saviour, <hi>I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat;</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Matth. 25.35, 36.</note> 
                           <hi>I was thirſty, and ye gave me drink; I was a ſtranger, and ye took me in; naked, and ye clothed me; I was ſick, and ye viſited me; I was in priſon, and ye came unto me.</hi> Oh the inconceiveable love of Chriſt! And Oh the divine comfort of the Soul! in this communion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Chriſt and the Faithful: As the Faithful communicate with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Chriſt in his benefits; ſo Chriſt he communicates with the Faithful in their ſufferings: As wiſdom, righteouſneſs, peace, joy, life, glory, are ſuch wherein the Faithful communicate with Chriſt; ſo hunger, thirſt, nakedneſs, ſickneſs, impriſonment, are ſuch wherein Chriſt communicates with the Faithful. And what is the ground and reaſon of all this, but the union of Chriſt, and the Church, like that of the Head and the Body? So that, though the Faithful man be in himſelf never ſo poor, yet in Chriſt he is abundantly rich; though in him <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> ſelf never ſo deſpicable, yet in Chriſt he is highly exalted; though in himſelf never ſo miſerable, yet in Chriſt he is eternally happy. And ſo again, <hi>vice verſá;</hi> Our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, though in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf never ſo rich, yet in the Faithful he ſtill ſuffers poverty; though in himſelf never ſo glorious, yet in his Saints he ſtill ſuffers ignominy; though in himſelf never ſo highly exalted, yet in his Members he ſtill ſuffers contempt.</p>

                        <p>This <hi>Beauty of the Lord,</hi> is of too glorious a ray to be beheld, otherways then under avail; and therefore, it is the goodneſs of our Maker, to exhibite himſelf; not according to the ſtrength of his glory, but according to the weakneſs of our capacity: The object is proportioned to the faculty, the Creatures are as the Waters, and his Word and Sacraments as the Mirrors, which repreſent

                        <p>But however <hi>David</hi> doth behold <hi>the beauty of the Lord</hi> in the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> yet where is that beauty in our Churches? what is that glory of his preſence, as may denominate them his Houſes?

And indeed, though true it is, That to the devout Saint and Servant of God, every day is a Sabbath, and every place a Temple; yet, as this does not exempt us from the obſervation of the Lords day, ſo nor from the frequenting Gods Houſe; for as the one is a ſet and holy time, ſo is the other a ſeparate and holy place, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> for his Publick worſhip; according to that,<note place="margin">Levit. 19.30.</note> 
                           <hi>Ye ſhall obſerve my Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths, and reverence my Sanctuary,</hi> which was ſpoken to the Jew in the Letter, but to the Chriſtian in the Analogy. And ſtrange it is, That they ſhould be ſo remiſs in reverencing Gods Sanctuary, who yet ſeem ſo zealous for obſerving his Sabbaths, dis-joyning in their practiſe, what God hath ſo near joyned in his Precept.</p>
                        <p>But, that we are to <hi>viſit Gods Sanctuary,</hi> and there attend his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, is not onely from the precept of holy Scripture, but alſo from <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> the dictate of <hi>Divine Reaſon;</hi> which is this, That, we are all to be conſidered in a double capacity, as to our particular perſons, and our Political Relations. Which Political Relations, are eſpecially two; the firſt, as to Civil Community; the ſecond, as to Myſtical Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion. Now, as in Temporal Matters, we have our private places for our private affairs; but publick Halls, for publick ſervices: So in Spiritual Matters, we have our private Cloſets, for our private De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:94092:187"/>
but publick Temples for publick Worſhip; Civil Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, as Members of ſome Corporation, requires the former; and no leſs doth our Myſtical Communion, as Members of the Church, require the latter.</p>
                        <p>But obſerve further, <hi>David,</hi> though ſo glorious a King, yet will become an attendant in Gods houſe. O the haughty pride then of the meaner Peaſant;<note place="margin">Pſal. 95.6.</note> who will not bow nor bend, not <hi>fall down and worſhip,</hi> in Gods Sanctuary! O the haughty pride, I ſay of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> meaner Peaſant! For who are they that ſo much contemn the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and deſpiſe the reverence due to God in his Temple; are they the mighty Kings, or the truly Noble; no, but the meaneſt, and the loweſt of the people.</p>
                        <p>Thus whilſt we ſee the Potentate proſtrate, we behold the Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant ſtiff in Gods ſervice; yea, at preſent do we not behold the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant covered, whilſt the Maſter is bare in Gods preſence? Strange diſorder, as unreaſonable as it is irreverent; which to reform, know,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> all actions (we ſay in the <hi>Schools</hi>) are ſpecified <hi>ab objecto &amp; fine,</hi> from their object and their end; what then is civil in reſpect of men and ſecular Affairs, is Religions in reſpect of God and his glory.</p>
                        <p>And thus bowing the Knee, uncovering the Head, and the like, which are civil actions in a reſpect to men, they become Religious and Divine, having God for their object, and his glory for their end: The Soul actuating the Body, an holy Fear actuating the Soul, and the Spirit of God actuating that holy Fear.

                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> a mans uncovering of the Head in Gods Houſe, is a part of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; and a keeping the Head bare, is a continued worſhipping; and if ſo, then not to bare the Head, is irreverence, if not propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
